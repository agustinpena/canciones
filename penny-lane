# 'Penny Lane', by the Beatles

Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say 'Hello!'

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The Little Children Laugh at Him Behind his Back
And the banker never wears a mac
in the pouring rain... Vey strange!

Penn Lane in in my ears and in my eyes
There, beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
